Acute respiratory infection (ARI),"An acute respiratory tract disease that is caused by an infectious agent. Although the spectrum of symptoms of ARI may vary, the onset of symptoms is typically rapid, ranging from hours to days after infection. Symptoms include fever, cough and, often, sore throat, coryza, shortness of breath, wheezing, or difficulty in breathing. The pathogens that cause this disease include influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV).",World Health Organization.

Air quality indices,"An aggregated evaluation of the pollutant load of the atmosphere across multiple constituents, generally developed to compare environmental conditions to biological outcomes with an emphasis on human health. The indices also provide a concise method of informing the general public regarding atmospheric conditions by incorporating a suite of pollutants into one single measure. The method of aggregation varies from index to index, with some emphasising the single pollutant observed at the highest/most threatening concentration, whereas others consider the effects of all pollutants simultaneously (Kyrkilis et al. 2007). In the US, the air quality index is determined by the maximum concentration of ozone, particulate pollution, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide, where the concentration of each pollutant is normalized on a unitless 1–500 scale, where a value of 100 corresponds to the relevant national ambient air quality standard. The overall index value is set as that associated with the highest normalised score for any individual variable (Bishoi et al. 2009). A similar system based on the pollutant with the highest relative concentration is used in the UK, but values are converted to a 1–10 scale for communication to the public (Holgate 2011).",Global Heat Health Information Network.

CO2-equivalent ,"The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission that would cause the same integrated radiative forcing or temperature change, over a given time horizon, as an emitted amount of a greenhouse gas (GHG) or a mixture of GHGs.

Most typically, the CO2-equivalent emission is obtained by multiplying the emission of a GHG by its global warming potential (GWP) for a 100-year time horizon. For a mix of GHGs it is obtained by summing the CO2-equivalent emissions of each gas. CO2-equivalent emission is a common scale for comparing emissions of different GHGs but does not imply equivalence of the corresponding climate change responses.

Climate change,"Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use. Note that the Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in its Article 1, defines climate change as: ‘a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.’ The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate change attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric composition and climate variability attributable to natural causes.

This is completed by evaluating the frequency distributions for 10-day intervals derived from the meteorological variables, with percentile values determined for each parameter. The final daily HSI (%) is based on the location of the daily summed value under the distribution curve (Watts and Kalkstein 2004).

Thermal comfort,"Thermal comfort is the condition of mind that expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment; however, due to large physiological and psychological variations from one person to another, it is difficult to maintain thermal comfort in one given space for all (ASHRAE 2004), whether it be indoors or outdoors. It is crucial for human beings to maintain a constant core body temperature of 37 °C (98 °F). However, the temperature away from the core, such as on the skin and extremities for instance, can vary considerably with environmental and metabolic heat loads. To maintain the core body temperature, heat is exchanged with the environment by respiration (latent and sensible heat fluxes), radiation (longwave and shortwave), evaporation (latent heat flux), conduction (contact with solids), and convection (sensible heat flux) (Jendritzky and de Dear 2009). To this end, the human thermoregulatory system can be separated into active and passive interacting systems. The active system concerns the thermoregulatory response (e.g. shivering or perspiring) and the passive system deals with heat transfers at the body surface. When the body is under thermal comfort conditions, the body is under least strain because the active system is at its lowest activity level. However, increasing discomfort is associated with increasing strain. Research shows that people take action to improve their comfort conditions by modifying their clothing and metabolic rate when outdoors, or by interacting with the building when they are indoors, which are considered actions of adaptation (Nicol and Humphreys 2002). When adaptation opportunity is limited, departure from neutrality causes stress and dissatisfaction (Baker and Standeven 1996). According to Nikolopoulou et al. (2001), intrinsic factors such as past experience, expectations and time of exposure are also important for thermal comfort.",Global Heat Health Information Network.

Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT),"Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) is the most widely used heat index because it is an international standard for heat stress (Budd, 2008; Buzan et al., 2015, ISO 7243-2017). It was originally developed in the 1950s as part of a campaign to lower the risk of heat disorders during the training of US Army and Marine troops (Minard, 1961).
Wet bulb globe temperature is calculated using observations from a wet bulb thermometer – a thermometer wrapped in a damp muslin cloth, a globe thermometer to measure incidence of radiation and a dry air thermometer. Or it is approximated using empirical models of these values (Davies-Jones, 2008; Liljegren et al., 2008; Stull, 2011).
The equation for an outdoor WBGT is: WBGT=0.7Tw+0.2Tg+0.1Td 
The equation for an indoor WBGT is: WBGT=0.7Tw+0.3Tg
Where Tw is Wet Bulb Temperature (°C), Tg is Globe Temperature(°C) and Td is air temperature (°C).",Brimicombe C.
